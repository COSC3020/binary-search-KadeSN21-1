# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

Help: ChatGPT Helped by providing a binary search code example which retured the target value, this helped further my understanding of what a reccursive binary search looks like in code form in python. I then wrote an itterive binary search to return the index of the target value.
